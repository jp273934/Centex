                <h2>GORBEL G-force</h2>
                <p>Gorbel&#39;s G-Force&#174; Intelligent Lifting Devices enable operators to lift and maneuver naturally, as if the devices were an extension of their arms. There are two G-Force&#174; models to choose from: the Q and the iQ. The Q model is our feature packed base model. It offers the same speed and precision as our higher-end iQ model, but without the added Input/Output features that the iQ offers. The iQ model offers a wealth of additional intelligence features. </p>
                <p>G-Force® technology fills the void between traditional lifting devices and completely automated robotic solutions. These devices use the human’s intelligence and adaptability for guidance but the work is done by the device. </p>

                <p>All of Gorbel's G-Force Intelligent Lifting products come with float mode as a standard feature.</p>
